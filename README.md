##  ‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT BROWSER AUTO OPEN NOTICE‚ö†Ô∏è

*Note 1*

This script was built with the understanding that the links provided to you are uniquely generated. Until I can confirm otherwise, you should be very careful about using BOTH the auto browser open feature and the Telegram notification at the same time.

"Why?" I hear you ask - well if the link is unique, if it has automatically opened in your browser, then it's probably not going to work for you if you open it from Telegram on another device.

So, if your main use case is that you want to open the link from Telegram (you might not be at the machine running the script when the stock ping arrives), then DISABLE the auto browser open in config.py

`"open_browser": False,`

This will stop the browser from auto-opening the new links, but will still send them to you via Telegram.

*Note 2*

If you have the browser auto-open enabled, I'd strongly recommend running the script with the "--test" arg at least once. This will let you test to see if the browser opens correctly (it uses your default OS browser). After the configured cooldown period, the script will run in normal mode, so feel free to start using the "--test" arg every time for safety. There are a lot more args listed below, mostly used for me to test things work with the script, but I left them in the code in case you find them useful.

## Usage

### Running the Script

To start monitoring NVIDIA stock, run the script with the following command:

```bash
python 50check.py
```

### Command-Line Arguments

The script supports several command-line arguments for customization. Most users should set their configuration via "config.py". The Command-line args are simply for customising checks on the fly, without having to keep editing "config.py".

| Argument               | Description                                                                 |

| `--telegram-chat-id`   | Telegram chat ID (overrides configuration).                                 |
| `--no-sound`           | Disable notification sounds.                                                |
| `--no-browser`         | Disable automatic browser opening.                                          |

### Example Commands
